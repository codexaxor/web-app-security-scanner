# Decisions log

Newest first. One entry per decision. Claude Code adds entries for every new dependency, tool, or choice the spec
did not cover. Never delete an entry; supersede it with a new one.

Format:

```
## D-<nnn> <title> (<YYYY-MM-DD>, <status: accepted | superseded by D-xxx | open>)
Context: why we had to decide.
Decision: what we chose.
Consequences: what this implies / what we gave up.
```

## D-008 Branching model: main / develop / feature (2026-10-11, accepted)
Context: Work is done by an AI agent; we need reviewable, reversible units.
Decision: `main` (stable, tagged per milestone), `develop` (integration), `feature/m<N>-<slug>` per milestone.
No direct commits to `main`/`develop`. See `docs/WORKFLOW.md`.
Consequences: every milestone is one PR, easy to review and revert.

## D-007 Change detection by polling, not webhooks (2026-10-11, accepted)
Context: Creating GitLab project hooks needs the write `api` scope.
Decision: Poll the default branch SHA every 15 min with a read-only token.
Consequences: up to 15 min delay; no write access needed.

## D-006 OSV-Scanner online mode (2026-10-11, accepted)
Context: Offline mode disables Maven transitive resolution.
Decision: Use online osv.dev / deps.dev; cache advisories locally.
Consequences: scanner needs egress to api.osv.dev and api.deps.dev.

## D-005 Opengrep for SAST (2026-10-11, accepted)
Context: Semgrep CE lacks cross-file taint; Opengrep is the LGPL-2.1 community fork (Aikido co-founded it).
Decision: Opengrep with pinned rule bundles + our custom rules.
Consequences: rule-pack licences must be rechecked before any SaaS use.

## D-004 Never execute scanned repositories' code (2026-10-11, accepted)
Context: Running builds on untrusted repos is a code-execution risk.
Decision: Parse files only. Gradle/.NET without lockfiles get a warning and partial results.
Consequences: incomplete SCA for repos without lockfiles until open decision OD-1/OD-2 is resolved.

## D-003 Postgres as job queue (2026-10-11, accepted)
Decision: `scan_job` table with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`; no Redis/RabbitMQ.

## D-002 Two profiles, one codebase (2026-10-11, accepted)
Decision: Spring Boot `api` and `worker` profiles from the same app module.

## D-001 Tenant-ready schema (2026-10-11, accepted)
Decision: `workspace_id` on every business table from day one.
