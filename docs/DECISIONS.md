## D-023 Scanner image: Alpine (digest-pinned) + Gitleaks (checksum-pinned); in-container secret sanitize (2026-10-13, accepted)
Context: M2 needs a disposable scanner container with git + a secrets scanner, and secret findings must never
store or leak the raw value (CLAUDE.md security rules).
Decision: `scanner-image/` builds from `alpine:3.21` pinned by digest, adds git + jq, and installs Gitleaks
8.21.2 verified against its published SHA-256 (per-arch). `run-scan.sh` clones one commit into tmpfs `/work`,
runs `gitleaks dir --no-banner --report-format json` (exit 0 or 1 = success; any other code = scanner failure),
then computes the SHA-256 and 4-char preview of each secret **inside the container** and writes only those,
with the repo-relative file path and start line, to `/out/secrets.json` — the raw value never leaves the
container. A manifest `/out/result.json` carries the cloned commit, tool versions and per-scanner status. The
token, when present, arrives only as a read-only file and is sent as a basic-auth header via a tmpfs git config,
never in the URL/env/argv/logs (D-014). apk package versions are not individually pinned (follow the pinned
Alpine branch) — see Known gaps.
Consequences: reproducible scanner builds; the strongest secret-handling posture (raw secret dies with the
container); OSV-Scanner/Opengrep/Checkov are added to this same image in M4/M6.

## D-020 Multiple connections, project-mode targets, and reassignment on removal (2026-10-12, accepted)
Context: M1b lets a workspace connect a whole group and/or several single projects; removing a connection must
not lose repositories (scan history hangs off them from M2) and must keep a clone path resolvable.
Decision: `gitlab_connection` gains `target_type` (`group`|`project`), `gitlab_project_id`, `project_full_path`
and `last_verified_at` (V5); the one-per-workspace unique is dropped and replaced by partial unique indexes
per group and per project. A connection is tested/created via `POST /connections` and its token rotated via
`PUT /connections/{id}` (same target only; a different target means a new connection); the old singular
`/connection` endpoints are removed. Project mode resolves `GET /projects/:url-encoded-path`, reusing the same
allowed-hosts check, no-redirect client, scope/expiry checks and pasted-URL support as group mode. Removing a
connection never deletes repository rows: each is reassigned — to a project-mode connection for the same
`gitlab_project_id`, else the group connection whose `group_full_path` is the longest namespace prefix of the
repo path, newest-verified breaking a tie (offline, no GitLab call at delete time) — or, if none, detached
(`connection_id` nullable) and deactivated with `inactive_reason = NO_ACCESSIBLE_CONNECTION`. A reassignment is
provisional (`reassigned_at`): the next use of the new connection confirms it, or, on a 401/403/404,
deactivates the repo. First-wins dedup applies only while a repository is owned and active; a detached or
inactive repository is reattached to the connection that next selects it (clearing the inactive/provisional
state). The tie-break prefers the most-recently-verified connection and treats a null `last_verified_at` as
oldest (existing rows are backfilled to `created_at` in V5). A concurrent duplicate `create` is caught via the
partial unique index and returned as `CONNECTION_EXISTS`, not a 500. Reassignments/deactivations are logged (a
persistent `triage_event` arrives with M3).
Consequences: additive, reversible connection management; a repo can briefly point at a connection that cannot
reach it, resolved on first use; delete works even with the VPN down or a token expired.

## D-019 Repository dedup and connection ownership (2026-10-12, accepted)
Context: Multiple connections (M1b) could surface the same GitLab project; a repository must exist once per
workspace, and we must know which connection to use to clone it.
Decision: A repository is unique per workspace on `gitlab_project_id` (already enforced by
`uq_repository_workspace_project`). `repository.connection_id` records the connection used to clone it. When a
connection is removed, its repositories are reassigned to another connection that exposes the same project, or
deactivated if none does. Changing an existing connection's group is rejected for now (M1); the reassign/
deactivate behavior is implemented in M1b.
Consequences: no duplicate repositories; clone credentials always resolve to a real connection.

## D-018 Outbound GitLab host allowlist (2026-10-12, accepted)
Context: The server makes outbound calls to a user-supplied GitLab base URL — an SSRF risk if unconstrained.
Decision: `SECSCAN_GITLAB_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (comma-separated, empty = deny all) lists the hosts the app may call.
Every outbound GitLab call requires `https` and an allowlisted host before the request is made; loopback hosts
may use `http` (for a local/mock GitLab) but must still be allowlisted. A disallowed host or scheme fails with a
clear `HOST_NOT_ALLOWED` error. A pasted group URL for a non-allowlisted host is rejected the same way.
Consequences: the base URL cannot be pointed at arbitrary internal services; operators opt hosts in explicitly.

## D-017 Encryption key handling (2026-10-12, accepted)
Context: GitLab tokens are encrypted with `SECSCAN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; we must fail safe, never store plaintext.
Decision: If the key is present it must base64-decode to exactly 32 bytes, validated at startup — an invalid
key fails startup with a clear message. If absent, the app still starts and saving/using a connection returns a
clear "encryption key not configured" error (never a plaintext fallback). Changing the key makes stored tokens
unreadable, so you must reconnect; key rotation is a later feature.
Consequences: safe-by-default; a documented reconnect step if the key changes.

## D-016 GitLab group resolution and single connection (2026-10-12, accepted)
Context: Project listing needs a group; paths can be renamed.
Decision: Resolve the group with `GET /groups/:url-encoded-path` and store its numeric `gitlab_group_id` plus
`full_path`; use the id for all later calls. One connection per workspace in M1, with a clear error when the
group is not found or not visible. The data model stays open to more connections/groups later (no UI for that
now). This extends the spec's `gitlab_connection` columns with `group_full_path` and `gitlab_group_id`.
Consequences: stable against group renames; multi-connection is a later, additive change.

## D-015 GitLab client = Spring RestClient; WireMock for tests (2026-10-12, accepted)
Decision: Use Spring `RestClient` (sync) for GitLab REST v4 with explicit connect/read timeouts; test it with
WireMock (dep `org.wiremock:wiremock-standalone`). TLS verification is never disabled.
Consequences: a new test dependency; real-GitLab verification is a manual step.

## D-014 Token decrypted in-memory in api and worker (2026-10-12, accepted)
Context: The api needs the token for the connection test, project listing and commit polling; a worker-only
decrypt would force a job round-trip onto synchronous UI actions.
Decision: Decrypt the token in-memory in whichever process needs it — the api (test/listing/polling) and the
worker (scanner clone hand-off via a one-time file). Never logged, never in env vars or URLs. The scanner
container only ever sees the token via a one-time file. This reclarifies the earlier "decrypted only in the
worker" wording in CLAUDE.md.
Consequences: simpler synchronous UX; the "worker-only" rule now means "the scanner container, not the api."

## D-013 GitLab instance (resolves OD-4) (2026-10-12, accepted)
Context: We need the target GitLab to build M1 against.
Decision: Self-managed GitLab at `https://gitlab.celloscope.net`, reached over VPN, with a valid public TLS
certificate and reachable from inside Docker containers (no custom CA or DNS). TLS verification is never
disabled. The GitLab version is read from `/version` at connect time rather than pinned.
Consequences: OD-4 is resolved except the version (runtime). No token yet, so M1 is built/tested against a
mocked GitLab (WireMock); the real-GitLab connect is a manual check.

## D-012 Local mode: no PRs or CI until we deploy (2026-10-11, accepted)
Context: everything runs locally; nothing is deployed.
Decision: the local `./gradlew build` is the gate; milestones are reviewed (`/review-pr`) and merged locally by a
human with `--no-ff`; GitHub is a backup remote.
Consequences: no automated gate — the review step must not be skipped; re-enable CI and PRs when we deploy.

## D-011 Bootstrap admin from env, seed workspace via migration (2026-10-11, accepted)
Context: We need a usable login in single-tenant mode without putting any password in git.
Decision: `V2__default_workspace.sql` seeds one workspace (fixed UUID, name "Default") — real data every
table needs in single-tenant mode. The admin user is NOT seeded by migration; on startup (api profile), if
`app_user` is empty and `SECSCAN_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `SECSCAN_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` are set, create
one admin (bcrypt) in the default workspace. Log the email, never the password.
Consequences: no secrets in migrations; first run is reproducible; roles still deferred to M10.

## D-010 Minimal Spring Security in M0 (2026-10-11, accepted)
Context: The app must boot and be reachable, but real auth/roles are M10 and M1 must not be blocked.
Decision: `/actuator/health` public; `/api/**` requires HTTP Basic against `app_user` (bcrypt). No roles yet.
No Spring default generated password or default login page.
Consequences: M1 can call `/api/**` with Basic auth; role-based authorization added in M10.

## D-009 Build toolchain: Gradle wrapper 8.10.2, Java 21, version catalog (2026-10-11, accepted)
Context: System Gradle is 6.9.4 (too old for Spring Boot 3); default JDK on the host is 25, but we target Java 21.
Decision: Commit a Gradle wrapper pinned to 8.10.2; pin a Java 21 toolchain in Gradle; keep dependency versions
in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`; one Docker image serves both profiles, selected by `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`;
the worker does not mount the Docker socket in M0 (that arrives in M2).
Consequences: reproducible builds regardless of host JDK; `./gradlew` is the only supported build entrypoint.

## D-008 Branching model: main / develop / feature (2026-10-11, accepted, superseded in part by D-012 (no PRs))
Context: Work is done by an AI agent; we need reviewable, reversible units.
Decision: `main` (stable, tagged per milestone), `develop` (integration), `feature/m<N>-<slug>` per milestone.
No direct commits to `main`/`develop`. See `docs/WORKFLOW.md`.
Consequences: every milestone is one PR, easy to review and revert.

## D-007 Change detection by polling, not webhooks (2026-10-11, accepted)
Context: Creating GitLab project hooks needs the write `api` scope.
Decision: Poll the default branch SHA every 15 min with a read-only token.
Consequences: up to 15 min delay; no write access needed.

## D-006 OSV-Scanner online mode (2026-10-11, accepted)
Context: Offline mode disables Maven transitive resolution.
Decision: Use online osv.dev / deps.dev; cache advisories locally.
Consequences: scanner needs egress to api.osv.dev and api.deps.dev.

## D-005 Opengrep for SAST (2026-10-11, accepted)
Context: Semgrep CE lacks cross-file taint; Opengrep is the LGPL-2.1 community fork (Aikido co-founded it).
Decision: Opengrep with pinned rule bundles + our custom rules.
Consequences: rule-pack licences must be rechecked before any SaaS use.

## D-004 Never execute scanned repositories' code (2026-10-11, accepted)
Context: Running builds on untrusted repos is a code-execution risk.
Decision: Parse files only. Gradle/.NET without lockfiles get a warning and partial results.
Consequences: incomplete SCA for repos without lockfiles until open decision OD-1/OD-2 is resolved.

## D-003 Postgres as job queue (2026-10-11, accepted)
Decision: `scan_job` table with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`; no Redis/RabbitMQ.

## D-002 Two profiles, one codebase (2026-10-11, accepted)
Decision: Spring Boot `api` and `worker` profiles from the same app module.

## D-001 Tenant-ready schema (2026-10-11, accepted)
Decision: `workspace_id` on every business table from day one.

## D-021 M1b real-GitLab check deferred to M2 (2026-10-13, accepted)
Context: M1b logic is covered by WireMock + Testcontainers tests; M1 already proved real GitLab connectivity.
Decision: Merge M1b without its manual real-GitLab check; run it as part of the M2 manual run.
Consequences: M2's report must include the M1b project-connection check (group + project, dedup, reassignment).
